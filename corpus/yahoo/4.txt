In the event that you -- like WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange -- found yourself omitted from the guest list for the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, fret not. There's still a way for card-carrying members of the peasantry to enter through the back door, shall we say.
Yes, should you desire to rub elbows with heavyweights of the neo-liberal policy elite such asÂ  Bill Clinton and George Soros this January, you can submit a one-minute video to YouTube explaining, in the words of Forum organizers, "your ideas and solutions on the importance of inclusive growth, i.e. how everyone can benefit from economic prosperity."
The lucky winner will be invited to the event -- where anti-capitalist and anti-globalization activists typically turn out in full force to protest -- as an "informal YouTube community representative." Sure, it doesn't have quite the ring of "former president" or "international investment titan," but it will get you past the velvet rope -- and out of reach of the restive mobs of protesters outside.
 So if you'd like to attend the event that U2 frontman Bono once called a meeting of "fat cats in the snow," here's a brief video explaining the contest in full. Good luck!
