Busty restaurant chain Hooters is hitting back against a women's group that says the chain is breaking the law by serving children.
Hooters' brand of sex appeal is "wholesome" and all-American, and thus compatible with a child clientele, according to a statement by the company's marketing vice president, Mike McNeil.
"Hooters Girls are sexy and vivacious. The element of sex appeal is certainly prevalent in our restaurants, and is the essence of the Hooters experience, but the Hooters brand of sex appeal is wholesome and that of the all-American cheerleader, not a seedy strip club," said McNeil. "It is time for NOW to accept the fact that the public likes Hooters and there is really nothing they can do about it. Hooters is no more in violation of California's adult entertainment codes than the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition is. However, guys can't do that job, either."
The National Organization for Women argues that the restaurant is violating California law by classifying itself as "adult entertainment" but allowing children to patronize its restaurants. The "adult" classification allows Hooters to hire primarily young and attractive women without worry of discrimination lawsuits.
McNeil says that authorities have not contacted the restaurant chain about the complains and that the publicity has boosted sales in the past 24 hours.
