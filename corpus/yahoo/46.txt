HARARE (AFP) â€“ Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai on Monday urged their supporters to shun violence ahead of the country's elections planned for next year.
"What we would want to get to our people is our voice and our command that there should be no violence, but that does not mean that everybody will listen to us," Mugabe said at a joint end-of-year news conference with Tsvangirai.
"Having found each other as Zimbabweans we had no option, but to work together. Today we have greater political stability than ever before. There is peace," said Mugabe.
Mugabe was last weekend endorsed by his ZANU-PF party as the candidate for the elections mooted for 2011.
Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has also conceded that a presidential election could take place in 2011, but ruled out parliamentary polls until 2013.
"We come from different political parties and when we have differences we go for each other's throat at party level, but let it not be said because of that we are dysfunctional," Mugabe said.
In 2008, the two leaders entered into an uneasy power-sharing deal, following months of political turmoil over the outcome of a violence marred presidential run-off.
Tsvangarai has struggled to assert his authority in the unity government, with Mugabe making key appointments without consulting him.
"Yes, there are incidences of violence and we have witnessed it and we are committed as leaders to ensure that the next election is certainly not characterised by a culture of violence," said Tsvangirai.
"That demon must be ostracized, it is a demon that no-one wants," he added.
The two leaders could not be drawn into giving indications when the polls would be held, saying that a referendum for a new constitution would first have to be finalised.
