The prospect that banks and others could be held criminally liable for mortgage fraud got a boost Monday, as Iowa's attorney general and federal prosecutors announced (PDF) that they're teaming up to "identify and investigate targets for criminal prosecution."
"There are some situations where civil enforcement efforts simply are not enough to punish the wrongdoers," said Attorney General Tom Miller. "We look forward to working with the United States attorney to ensure that criminal enforcement tools are also available."
Last week, Miller signaled that the partnership could produce serious results, telling a group of homeowners: "We will put people in jail." But his office had not announced details of the effort until now. The announcement did not identify potential targets of the effort.

Separately, Miller has been leading a nationwide task force of 50 state attorneys general that's investigating the foreclosure mess, in which major banks like Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase are accused of cutting corners on paperwork to improperly push borrowers from their homes. Miller has said that that probe is focused on a potential civil settlement.
Last Friday, attorneys general for Arizona and Nevada filed civil lawsuits against Bank of America, charging the firm with misleading borrowers about their eligibility for modifications of their home loans. We'll have more on those proceedings later.
