MADRID â€“ Spanish police say they have recovered artworks including pieces by Picasso, Colombian artist Fernando Botero and Spanish sculptor Eduardo Chillida that were stolen from a Madrid warehouse.
Specialized Crimes unit chief Dionisio Martin said Monday the art was found in a stolen truck in an industrial area on Madrid's southern outskirts.
The pieces, recovered Saturday, had a total value of some euro5 million ($6.5 million), Martin said.
He said 35 pieces were stolen and one remains missing. No arrests have been made so far.
Martin said the thieves had tried to sell one of Chillida's metal sculptures to a scrap dealer.
The works were stolen on Nov. 27 by thieves who broke into the warehouse and stole a vehicle containing them.
