WASHINGTON (AFP) â€“ US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will travel to Brasilia on New Year's day to attend the inauguration of Brazilian President-elect Dilma Rousseff, the State Department said Monday.
"Brazil is an essential partner in the hemisphere and the world," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley told reporters.
"The United States is committed to deepening our relationship on a wide range of bilateral, regional and global issues with Brazil's government and people," he added.
"The United States looks forward to work with President-elect Rousseff and her administration to advance these and other shared goals," he said.
Rousseff, elected in October, is the first woman voters chose as Brazil's leader.
In Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's eight years in power, he was a driving force in raising Brasilia's profile internationally and helping bring national prosperity to Latin America's biggest economy.
Rousseff has vowed to continue his policies, though she faces challenges from a fragile global economy, rising inflation and infrastructure unable to keep up with Brazil's growth of over seven percent.
