LONDON (AFP) â€“ Andy Murray has said he will continue to work with coach Alex Corretja for the first part of the 2011 season and will re-assess the situation after that.
The Spaniard starting working with the Scot after the world number four sacked Miles Maclagan in July, having previously been only a part-time member of 'Team Murray' and the two-time French Open finalist was at the Scot's side during the latter part of the 2010 season.
Murray has repeatedly said he will not be rushed into appointing a permanent successor to Maclagan, preferring to take his time to ensure he finds the right coach to guide him through what could well be the peak of his career.
The 23-year-old will also continue to be assisted by long-time friend and occasional doubles partner Dani Vallverdu, who he met when they were both at the Sanchez-Casal Tennis Academy in Barcelona as juniors.
A statement on Murray's website today said: "Andy has taken time out from his busy pre-season fitness training to confirm that the current coaching set-up, with both Alex Corretja and Dani Vallverdu, will continue into the first half of next year.
"The guys are busy planning their tournament schedule for the early part of 2011 and are, as a team, very focused on preparing in the best way possible for each tournament."
Murray, Corretja and Venezuelan Vallverdu are currently in Miami, which the British number one is once again using as a base for his pre-season training.
For the second season running he will warm up for the Australian Open by teaming up with Laura Robson for the Hopman Cup in Perth at the start of next month before heading to Melbourne.
