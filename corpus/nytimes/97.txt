With the $3 cupcake firmly entrenched across America, there’s a new contender for your playfully ironic baking dollar: designer organic Pop Tarts. The kitschy breakfast junk food is undergoing an artisanal reimagination thanks to Candice Reynolds, whose Atlanta-based Red Queen Tarts brings a small-batch, Slow Food ethos to that American classic.

Using heirloom cold-milled whole wheat from North Carolina, seasonal produce and local butter, Reynolds turns carefully chosen ingredients into flavors like cinnamon apple tatin, blueberry lemon curd and a pumpkin tart better suited for the end of a meal than for a wait for the school bus. Her poached-pear Pop Tart could be the most worthy of rapture: Anjou pears, stewed in clove and honeyed port, nestled between pockets of Sonora wheat pastry. No frosting? No problem; nothing else should get in the way of those pears.

“There are other ‘Pop Tarts’ on the market that are organic,” Reynolds said, “but they taste like the box they’re packaged in. I knew I could make them better.” Her passion is part-time, a growing diversion from her day job at an Atlanta catering company.

You could call Reynolds’s start-up an exercise in retro cutting edge: Red Queen has no storefront, no wholesale operation and no Web site. The tarts are currently available to the denizens of Atlanta’s vibrant farmers’ market scene. Reynolds brings her craft to the Serenbe Farmers and Artists Market in Fulton County and the Waleska and Woodstock markets in Cherokee, where urbanites mingle with the keepers of central Georgia’s breadbasket, and one can plan a menu around brussels sprouts the size of tennis balls.

Future flavors include handmade Nutella and lemon-blackberry. And yes, these Pop Tarts are even better after two minutes in the toaster.
