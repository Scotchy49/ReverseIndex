Public Health Wales said unless people's symptoms are very severe, they are pregnant or in an at-risk group, they can treat themselves at home without needing to visit emergency rooms that are already busy due to the weather.

Dr Marion Lyons of Public Health Wales, said: "Although flu is unpleasant, it usually resolves itself within a week and it is not advised that patients visit their GP surgery or A&E department.

Treacherous conditions

Travellers have faced treacherous conditions with snow and ice in many parts of Wales.
