The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has announced that it will set up its first office outside the United States in China in a bid to reduce the amount of dangerous products reaching the American market.

Commission head Inez Tenenbaum told reporters Monday that the "history-making" office would cut the number of unsafe products that reach the U.S. and help the U.S. raise concerns about issues including faulty drywall and toxic metals in toys.

China has been working to improve foreign consumer confidence in its exports after a series of food and product safety scandals, such as tainted fish and the use of lead-based paints on toys and other goods.
