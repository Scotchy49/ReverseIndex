Republican Mark Grisanti, a newcomer who defeated Democrat Antoine Thompson for a New York State Senate seat in November, will take over a key committee chairmanship from his former opponent.

The Buffalo News reported this week that Grisanti, a freshman from Erie County, was appointed by Dean Skelos, the new Senate majority leader, to chair the Senate Environmental Conservation Committee. The election flipped control of the Senate to the GOP.

The panel was previously chaired by Thompson, a veteran who also hails from Erie County and who authored the state's legislative ban on hydraulic fracturing.

Thompson's bill banning Marcellus Shale drilling in the state for a year passed the Senate in August. The General Assembly passed the same bill in November, but in December Governor David Paterson vetoed it and imposed instead a six-month-long moratorium on all drilling.

Grisanti said the position on the committee will put him squarely into the debate over fracking. "I'm open-minded with regard to that issue, but it has to be safe," Grisanti was quoted as saying.

He may have an opportunity to exercise his open-mindedness on that issue. State Senator Thomas Duane, a Democrat from New York City, has introduced two similar bills regarding Marcellus  drilling that are pending before the environmental conservation committee, S6654-2009 and S6244.

The first bill would permanently ban any  gas drilling within five miles of the New York City water supply infrastructure. The other bill, S6244, adds to that proposed ban any drilling in the state's Delaware River watershed.
