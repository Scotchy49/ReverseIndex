 MUMBAI, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Indian shares snapped a
four-session winning run and eased 0.3 percent on Tuesday, as
investors took profits amid concern accelerating inflation
pressures could push up borrowing costs.
 Lenders such as State Bank of India (SBI.BO), ICICI Bank
(ICBK.BO) and HDFC Bank (HDBK.BO), all of which had posted
spectacular gains in 2010, led the losers on talk the central
bank will raise interest rates.
 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which had raised rates six
times in 2010 before pausing in December, is scheduled to
review policy on Jan. 25.
 Expectations for good quarterly earnings helped limit the
drop in share prices.
 "The market may form a top before earnings come in next
week, which is generally the case when results are expected to
be good. There may be some consolidation after the results,"
said Arun Kejriwal, director of research firm KRIS.
 The 30-share BSE index .BSESN closed down 62.33 points at
20,498.72 with 18 of its components declining. The benchmark
had risen 17.4 percent in 2010 on the back of record foreign
portfolio investments of $29.3 billion.
 The banking sector index .BSEBANK dropped 2.5 percent,
after rallying more than a third in 2010.
 In the broader market, gainers and losers were nearly equal
in number on relatively better volume of 445 million shares.
 Top lender State Bank of India dropped 3.1 percent, while
ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank shed 3.5 percent and nearly 2 percent
respectively.
 "The RBI has tough choices to make -- tackling inflation
and taking care of growth," said Sunder Subramaniam, senior
manager of institutional sales at brokerage Sharekhan.
 "There are expectations building up that we could see an
interest rate hike in some time. Also, bank stocks have
performed well, and there is some profit booking."
 Maruti Suzuki (MRTI.BO), which sells every second new car
in India, closed 0.1 percent higher after it joined peers in
reporting strong December sales. [ID:nSGE70301W]
 Its sales rose an annual 17 percent in December, usually a
slower month, but were down 11.8 percent from November.
 Energy major giant Reliance Industries (RELI.BO) climbed
2.1 percent in an attempt to catch up after it underperformed
the Sensex with a nearly 3 percent decline in 2010.
 Firm base metal prices pushed non-ferrous metals producer
Sterlite Industries (STRL.BO) 0.6 percent higher.
 Three-month copper CMCU3 on the London Metal Exchange was
trading at $9,703 a tonne at 0752 GMT compared with $9,660 at
the close on Friday, buoyed by positive manufacturing data from
around the world. [ID:nL3E7C401H]
 Tata Steel (TISC.BO), the world's seventh-largest maker of
the alloy, dropped 1.3 percent on concerns steel mills face
higher costs after Australian coal mines were hit by flood.
 Spot coking coal prices have risen around 10 percent in a
month and look set to move sharply higher as Asia's steel mills
scour the globe for new suppliers to cover production lost to
Australian floods. [ID:nL3E7C4064]

6,146.35.

<.MIWD00000PUS and the emerging market sub-index .MSCIEF were
up 0.4 percent each.
 STOCKS THAT MOVED
 * Suzlon Energy (SUZL.BO) gained 2.6 percent to 55.65
rupees on heavy volume of 13.9 million shares, after television
channel CNBC-TV18 reported that Spain's Gamesa Corporacion
Tecnologica (GAM.MC) was in talks with the Indian wind turbine
maker to pick up a stake in the company.
 Suzlon said the report was "both speculative in nature and
inaccurate".
 * MOIL Ltd (MOIL.BO) and Jubilant Lifesciences (JULS.BO)
