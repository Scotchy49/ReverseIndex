“My fiance is deployed for the 7th time. These are words that are hard for any woman to say.”

So begins a letter from a female soldier engaged to a deployed soldier. The woman, Pfc. Deborah Flores from San Antonio, has herself been to Iraq and so knows all too well about the hardships her fiance has endured and the inner turmoil he may face when his deployment ends.

Some wives, she notes, “Will never know the full extent of the things their husbands have gone through. I will never have that luxury. I am a soldier.”

Private Flores’s letter is among more than a dozen items, including letters and photographs, sent to The New York Times by troops deployed in Afghanistan and their families back home. They have been published this black-and-white photograph of a combat outpost in Wardak Province, for instance, one can almost feel the cold and smell the dust of rural Afghanistan.

And then there is this letter from a soldier deployed to northern Afghanistan that serves to remind that the stress of deployment is not just about combat. In it, the soldier, Pfc. William Martin, writes that he has just learned that his younger brother had a stroke.

“I want nothing more than for him to be alive for many years to come,” Private Martin writes. “So fighting over here on the front lines isn’t always a battle with guns and motors. It can also be an emotional battle that is not always a good one. Thank you to all that have supported us and to all that keep our hopes high.”
